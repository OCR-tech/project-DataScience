# Heart Disease Classification

## Objectives:
- To classify the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics using a classification model
- To build a model using machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods
- To train and evaluate the model with prediction probabilities using a dataset of heart disease patients

## Steps:
1. Data pre-processing
    - Get data ready: images and labels
    - Create our own validation set
    - Preprocess images: turning into Tensors
    - Turn our data into batches
2. Building a model
    - Build a model using Keras sequential model and MobileNetV2
3. Training a model
    - Train a model using trained dataset
4. Model Evaluation
    - Make predictions on validation data using a trained model
5. Training a big dog model with full data
6. Deployment
    - Make predictions on test dataset and custom images

## Usages:
- Open [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/OCR-tech/project-DataScience/blob/main/2_Heart_Disease_Classification/notebook.ipynb) in Colab and run the code cells
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new data
- Save the trained model for future use

## Data:
- The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci), and contains information about heart disease patients, including various health metrics.

## Outcomes:
- A trained model capable of predicting heart disease presence based on patient health metrics.
- A well-documented and structured project that can be used for similar classification projects.
